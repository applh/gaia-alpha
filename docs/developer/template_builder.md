# Template Builder

The Template Builder is a powerful visual tool for constructing page layouts in Gaia Alpha. It allows you to create hierarchical structures using sections, columns, and content blocks.

## Interface Overview

The builder is divided into three main panels:

1.  **Toolbox (Left)**
    *   Contains draggable components.
    *   **Structure**: Sections, Columns.
    *   **Content**: Headings, Paragraphs, Images.
    *   **Delete**: Allows removing selected items from the tree.

2.  **Structure Tree (Center)**
    *   The core workspace where you build your layout.
    *   Displays the hierarchy of your template (Header, Main, Footer).
    *   Supports full Drag-and-Drop manipulation.

3.  **Live Preview (Right)**
    *   A real-time visual representation of your template.
    *   Updates instantly as you modify the structure tree.

## How to Use

### Adding Components
To add a component, click and drag it from the **Toolbox** into the **Structure Tree**.

*   **Root Level**: Drop items directly into the "Header", "Main", or "Footer" root containers.
*   **Nesting**: Drag items *inside* other containers (like Sections or Columns).

### Organizing Structure
The Tree View supports precise Drag-and-Drop placement:

*   **Insert Before**: Drag an item to the **top edge** of a target to place it *before*.
*   **Insert After**: Drag an item to the **bottom edge** of a target to place it *after*.
*   **Insert Inside**: Drag an item to the **center** of a container to place it *inside*.

Visual indicators (blue lines and highlights) will show you exactly where the item will land.

### Deleting Items
1.  Click on an item in the Structure Tree to select it (it will turn purple).
2.  Click the **Delete Selected** button at the bottom of the Toolbox.

## Component Types

*   **Section**: A container block, useful for grouping content.
*   **Columns**: A flexible layout block that splits content into side-by-side columns.
*   **Headings (H1, H2)**: Standard typography for titles.
*   **Paragraph**: Standard text block.
*   **Image**: A placeholder image block.
