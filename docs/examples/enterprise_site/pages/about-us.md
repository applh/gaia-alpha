# Precision in Motion

Founded in 2020 by a team of aerospace engineers and Olympic coaches, **SportFlow** was built on a single premise: performance is predictable when measurements are precise.

## Our Vision
To become the nervous system of modern athletics, providing the bridge between physical potential and digital optimization.

## The Lab
Our research facility in Zurich utilizes motion capture and sub-millimeter tracking to refine our algorithms before they hit the field.
